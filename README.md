:warning: :construction: Work in progress - it'll take a long while to translate whole book from Python to Ruby, stay tuned...

<br>

## Think Ruby Build

* LaTeX source, code examples, and exercise solutions
  * Based on **Think Python, 2nd edition, by Allen Downey** which can be downloaded in PDF from [Green Tea Press](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) or bought in paper and other formats from [O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920045267.do).

<br>

## Motivation

* An attempt to translate the wonderful Think Python to Think Ruby
* Help me learn and understand Ruby better
* Forced to learn LaTeX is a bonus

<br>

## Build instructions

* To build the book from source you will need a LaTeX installation
* TeX Live distribution is recommended with the following packages:
  * texlive-latex-base
  * texlive-latex-extra
  * texlive-fonts-recommended
